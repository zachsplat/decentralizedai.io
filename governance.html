      <h2>Platform Governance</h2>
      <p>Our platform is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which empowers token holders to actively participate in the decision-making processes and shape the future of the platform. The DAO ensures transparency, fairness, and community-driven governance.</p>
      <h3>Governance Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Proposal Submission: Token holders can submit proposals for platform upgrades, parameter changes, and community initiatives. Proposals are formalized through smart contracts and require a stake to prevent spam and ensure quality.</li>
        <li>Voting: Once a proposal is submitted, token holders can vote on its acceptance or rejection. The voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held, ensuring a fair and democratic process.</li>
        <li>Implementation: If a proposal receives the required threshold of votes, it is automatically implemented on the platform through smart contract execution. This ensures the integrity and transparency of the governance process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Incentive Mechanisms</h3>
      <p>To encourage active participation and contribution to the platform's governance, we have designed incentive mechanisms that reward token holders for their involvement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Staking Rewards: Token holders who stake their tokens to participate in governance receive staking rewards in the form of additional tokens. The rewards are proportional to the amount staked and the duration of the staking period.</li>
        <li>Reputation System: Contributors who actively participate in governance, provide valuable feedback, and contribute to the platform's development earn reputation points. These points can be used to access exclusive features, discounts, or voting power multipliers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By leveraging decentralized governance, our platform ensures that the direction and evolution of the project are aligned with the interests and needs of the community. It fosters a sense of ownership, collaboration, and long-term sustainability.</p>
